# See Today ðŸ¤“

`Version RC1`

See Today is an active focus diary application designed to support individuals interested in improving their vision habits. While inspired by the principles and concepts promoted by the endmyopia initiative, it's important to note that See Today is an independent project and is not officially affiliated with endmyopia.

The core aim of See Today is to cultivate a consistent daily routine centered around active focus. The application encourages users to engage in regular, intentional focus challenges for their eyes. Following each session, the app provides a structured way to log the details of the challenge, such as the duration, the type of focus activity performed, and any subjective observations about their vision during or after the exercise. By making it easy to record and review these daily activities, See Today helps users track their progress, identify patterns, and stay motivated in their journey towards better vision habits. It serves as a personal log and encouragement tool for those actively working on their focus.
